Servo Motors:
The ankle-mounted servo motor orchestrates the graceful and regulated movements of the foot, bolstering the robot's equilibrium and agility. Meanwhile, the hip-situated servo motor grants the robot the ability to sway laterally, endowing it with lateral dexterity and balance.

Revolute Joints:
The knee-based revolute joint empowers the leg to bend fluidly, mirroring the natural flexing motion of a human limb. Complementing this, the hip-located revolute joint facilitates forward propulsion, ensuring the robot can ambulate or traverse in a straight line with efficiency.

These meticulously integrated components coalesce to architect a versatile and nimble robotic leg, equipped to execute the diverse range of movements essential for dynamic locomotion.
